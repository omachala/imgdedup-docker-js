# Imagedup Docker

Just a docker/yarn wrapper for: [https://github.com/idealo/imagededup](https://github.com/idealo/imagededup)

## Usage

1. Add images to the `images/` folter.
2. Run `yarn build`
3. Run `yarn start`
4. See the `images/results.json` and/or `index.html`

For now it uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Can be easily change by updating the `run.py` file.
